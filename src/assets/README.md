# Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following Expo assets:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024 px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024 px)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48 px)

For now, the app will work without these files, but you should add them for a production build.

The icon should feature the blue gradient background with the hand + heart/shield symbol as designed in the AppIcon component.
